= C37-Platform

The C37 platform automates the deployment and management of a robust Kafka-based streaming ecosystem on Kubernetes and Docker environments. By leveraging Helm Charts and Docker Compose, it simplifies the setup and scalability of the Confluent Kafka ecosystem and is suitable for development, testing, and production environments. This platform integrates essential components such as Kafka, Kafka Connect, Schema Registry, REST Proxy, and a Kafka UI, offering comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities.

*In this project, Zookeeper was not used as Kafka > 3.2 supports internal clustering with KRaft for production environments.*

_The project was inspired by the Helm Charts https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-helm-charts[cp-helm-charts by Confluent Inc.] and https://github.com/rafaelmnatali/kafka-k8s[kafka-k8s by Rafael Natali]. Its aim is to utilize components of the Confluent Platform and to demonstrate and test the deployment of Kafka on Kubernetes._

== System Prerequisites
To successfully utilize the C37-Platform, you will need:

* *make*: For executing instructions in the Makefile.
* *docker* and *docker-compose*: For running services in containers.
* *helm*: For deploying on Kubernetes.
* *kcat* (formerly known as kafkacat): Essential for local Kafka testing, providing a command-line interface to produce and consume messages from Kafka topics.

_This project was rigorously tested on a MacBook Pro with an Apple M2 Max chip, 32 GB RAM under macOS Sonoma 14.2.1, Docker Desktop 4.27.2, and Kubernetes v1.29.1._

== Additional Tools Recommendation
For efficient management of Kubernetes clusters, we highly recommend using https://k9scli.io/[k9s]. It provides a user-friendly console interface that simplifies navigating, observing, and managing your clusters.

== Project Structure
The project structure is designed for ease of use and scalability, including the following main components and directories:

* `bin/`: Contains executable scripts for project initialization and maintenance.
* `helm-charts/`: Helm charts for deploying services on Kubernetes.
* `kafka-connect/`: Plugins for Kafka Connect, facilitating seamless data integration.
* `kafka-utility/`: Utilities for Kafka management tasks, enhancing operational efficiency.

== Deployment

=== Helm
Deploying with Helm offers a streamlined approach to managing Kafka clusters on Kubernetes. The charts are optimized for KRaft mode, eliminating the need for Zookeeper.

* `make helm-install` or `make hi`: Deploy the Kafka ecosystem on Kubernetes.
* `make helm-update` or `make hu`: Apply updates or configuration changes.
* `make helm-uninstall` or `make hd`: Remove the deployment from Kubernetes.

=== Docker
Docker and Docker-Compose provide a flexible alternative for environments better suited to container management.

* `make docker-build` or `make db`: Build Docker images for the stack.
* `make docker-up` or `make du`: Start the entire stack using Docker-Compose.
* `make docker-down` or `make dd`: Tear down the stack, removing containers and networks.
* `make docker-restart` or `make dr`: Swiftly restart the environment by combining `docker-down` and `docker-up`.

== Key Components

* *Kafka*: A distributed streaming platform that forms the backbone of our ecosystem.
* *Kafka Connect*: Facilitates the streaming of data between Kafka and other systems.
* *Kafka REST Proxy*: Provides RESTful access to Kafka clusters, enabling easy integration with other applications.
* *KSQL Server*: Enables real-time data processing, allowing for complex queries and data transformation.
* *Schema Registry*: Manages Avro schemas for Kafka topics, ensuring data consistency.
* *Kafka UI*: A web interface for cluster management, offering a visual overview of your Kafka environment.

== Conclusion

The C37-Platform provides a comprehensive solution for deploying and managing the Confluent Kafka ecosystem on both Kubernetes and Docker environments. With support for Helm charts and Docker Compose, it offers flexibility in deployment options, catering to a wide range of applications from development to production. We hope this platform empowers developers and system administrators alike to efficiently manage their Kafka-based streaming solutions.
