= C37-Platform

== Overview

The C37-Platform automates the deployment and management of a robust Kafka-based streaming ecosystem on Kubernetes and Docker environments. By leveraging Helm charts and Docker Compose, it simplifies the setup and scalability of the Confluent Kafka ecosystem, catering to development, testing, and production environments. This platform integrates essential components like Kafka brokers, Zookeeper, Kafka Connect, Schema Registry, REST Proxy, and a Kafka UI, enhancing monitoring and management capabilities.

_Inspired by_ the Helm charts https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-helm-charts[Confluent Inc.'s cp-helm-charts] and https://github.com/rafaelmnatali/kafka-k8s[Rafael Natali's kafka-k8s] for deploying Confluent platform components and demonstrating Kafka deployment on Kubernetes in Zookeeper and KRaft modes.

== Project Structure

* *Makefile*: Facilitates building and deployment processes with make commands.
* *README.adoc*: Offers project insights, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
* *helm/*: Hosts Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment.
* *docker-compose.yml*: Defines the Docker setup for deploying the Kafka ecosystem.

=== Helm Charts

* *cp-helm-charts*: Includes Helm charts for Confluent Platform components with Zookeeper.
* *cp-kraft-helm-charts*:  Includes Helm charts for Confluent Platform components with Kafka in KRaft mode.

=== Docker Deployment

The platform also supports deployment using Docker and Docker-Compose, providing an alternative to Kubernetes for environments better suited to container management.

== Key Components

* *Kafka*: A distributed streaming platform.
* *Kafka Connect*: Streams data between Kafka and other systems.
* *Kafka REST Proxy*: Provides RESTful access to Kafka clusters.
* *KSQL Server*: Enables real-time data processing.
* *Schema Registry*: Manages Avro schemas for Kafka topics.
* *Zookeeper*: Maintains configuration information.
* *Kafka UI*: Web interface for cluster management.

== Usage

=== Deploying with Helm

* *Install*: `make helm-install` or `make hi` to deploy the Kafka ecosystem on Kubernetes.
* *Update*: `make helm-update` or `make hu` for applying updates or configuration changes.
* *Uninstall*: `make helm-uninstall` or `make hd` to remove the deployment from Kubernetes.

=== Deploying with Docker

* *Build*: `make docker-build` or `make db` to build Docker images for the stack.
* *Up*: `make docker-up` or `make du` to start the entire stack using Docker-Compose.
* *Down*: `make docker-down` or `make dd` to tear down the stack, removing the containers and networks.
* *Restart*: `make docker-restart` or `make dr` combines the `docker-down` and `docker-up` targets in sequence, facilitating a swift restart of the environment.


=== Testing the Ecosystem (Helm/Kubernetes)

The following testing procedures are specifically designed for the Kubernetes/Helm deployment:

* *Produce Messages*: `make kafka-producer/TOPIC_NAME` to simulate data production within the Kubernetes environment.
* *Consume Messages*: `make kafka-consumer/TOPIC_NAME` for verifying data consumption within the Kubernetes environment.

== Conclusion

The C37-Platform provides a comprehensive solution for deploying and managing the Confluent Kafka ecosystem on both Kubernetes and Docker environments. With support for Helm charts and Docker Compose, it offers flexibility in deployment options, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from development to production.
