== Overview

This project is designed to deploy and manage a Kafka-based streaming platform on Kubernetes using Helm charts. It is inspired by and builds upon the foundations provided by the following projects:

* link:https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-helm-charts[Confluent Inc's cp-helm-charts] - Helm charts for deploying Confluent Platform components.
* link:https://github.com/rafaelmnatali/kafka-k8s[Rafael Natali's kafka-k8s] - A project demonstrating Kafka deployment on Kubernetes.

The project encompasses components such as Kafka, Kafka Connect, Kafka REST proxy, KSQL server, Schema Registry, Zookeeper, and a Kafka UI for monitoring and management.

== Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories and files:

* *Makefile* - Contains directives for the `make` command to automate the building and deployment process.
* *README.md* - Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
* *helm/* - Contains Helm charts for deploying the project components on Kubernetes.

=== Helm Charts

Within the *helm/* directory, there are two main subdirectories:

* *cp-helm-charts/*: Contains Helm charts for Confluent Platform components.
** *Chart.yaml*: Specifies the chart's metadata.
** *charts/*: Includes sub-charts for each component.
** *requirements.yaml*: Lists chart dependencies.

* *cp-kraft-helm-charts/*: A Helm chart for deploying a Kafka cluster in Kraft mode.
** *Chart.yaml*: Defines the chart's metadata.
** *values.yaml*: Provides default configuration values.
** *templates/*: Contains templates for Kubernetes resources.

== Key Components

The project includes several components critical for a Kafka-based streaming platform:

* *Kafka*: Distributed streaming platform for publishing and subscribing to streams of records.
* *Kafka Connect*: Tool for streaming data between Apache Kafka and other systems.
* *Kafka REST Proxy*: Provides a RESTful interface to Kafka clusters.
* *KSQL Server*: Enables real-time data processing against Kafka.
* *Schema Registry*: Manages Avro schemas for Kafka topics.
* *Zookeeper*: Centralized service for maintaining configuration information.
* *Kafka UI*: Web-based UI for managing Kafka clusters.

== Usage

=== Makefile Commands

The Makefile simplifies project management with commands such as:

* `make build`: Builds Docker images for the stack.
* `make up`: Starts the entire stack.
* `make down`: Tears down the stack.
* `make kafka
